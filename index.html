        <!-- In HTML5, you no longer have to have anything beyond <audio controls>, but because the last video had me write the code in this fashion, I was able to guess that I could add other attributes there and center the controls on my page. 
            
        You can also write <audio controls autoplay> to force the page to immediately play whatever sounds you wish.  I hate that on a page, but there ya go.
        -->
    
    <!-- <audio controls autoplay loop> I just tried this, and it didn't work at all.  I think I may have missed something.
        And again... draggable="true" does not work either, but EJ says that there is a second part that "recieves" what we are dragging and that is done in JavaScript or jQuery (I'm kind of terrified of those so far)-->
