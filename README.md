# Word-Guess-Game
This is my HW for JavaScript

I have learned an imense amount with this last homework assignment.  
I am still in the level of pseudo coding much of this, and while I did get it to run,
much of the true experience is that I feel familiar now in this area of coding.
A few of the functions still leave me a bit unsure how to explain everything that is happening in them.  
The coolest "tip" or "trick" I was introduced to was the realm of regular expressions.  
This helped make the game jump from almost playabel to actually working and 
being able to look at tweaking it to do more of the exciting things I hoped for.
I still can not get the audio to work at loading, but that seems to be the work of W3C recognizing that 
no one really likes audio to attack you and has made the default that audio has to be started by the user.

I also learned how important it is to run my code through a code checker, and I have more growing to do in that.
By checking the HTML I found some really beginner mistakes that changed EVERYTHING, and after submitting the homework I found 
several other sites that will check css and JS for you as well.  In the future I will be doing that with everything I think.

This version of the word guess game will allow others to see a version of how using an array for the song title choices worked out.

Things I still desire to learn how to conquer would be how to get the checking of the letter values against the letter values in the answer and instead of returning everything in lowercase, but to actually have the title appear as a human would think of it.  
It would also be helpful to learn how to get the spaces in between words to either not have to be involved as a guess, or if they must be part of it, to not have the empty space removed from inbetween the words in the title.
